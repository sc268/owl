This blog is the third website I built in recent few years. Since my first website at age 10 (unfortunately the web domain is gone), front-end technologies evolve tremendously rapid, I still remember the era of FrontPage 98, Flash, Dreamweaver, etc. Luckily, thanks to the communities (stackoverflow, github, etc), every time I tried something new and failed, I was able to figure out a solution, and built up step by step. I had a good time go through this learning process, and here's a brief list of technologies involved of my work.


1. personal website
![mysite tag](/images/201606_mysite.png){: .center-image }
* host on gitpage (git page)
* basic CSS & JS.

2. wedding website

* Embedded Google maps JS.
* back-end statistics: SQL.
* Gallery: JS.
* RSVP forms: PHP. 
* Embedded full screen video.

3. blog
![blog tag](/images/201606_blog.png){: .center-image }
* powered by static site generator Jekyll.
* comment system uses Disqus.
* again hosted on Github. 

I'd love to share my thoughts and I look forward to getting feedbacks here. Thanks for your visit!
